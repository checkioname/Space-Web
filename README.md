# Space-Web


This project started as a challenge to me, however, it really helped me to practice some skills. Having said that, I’m open to receive some tips if necessary. 

Furthermore, I plan on redoing this project using react or another framework.

I’m still trying to figure out how to post the whole site on gihtub pages ^_^

So, enjoy some screenshots
